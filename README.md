# Eternal Guardian

A moderation bot for the [Roguelikes Discord server](https://discord.gg/9pmFGKx).

To run your own instance of Eternal Guardian, you will need to create "EGKeys.py" with a variable `TOKEN` set to your own bot token, and "banned_words.py" (unless you just remove this part of the code) with a list of restricted words and words that instamute.
